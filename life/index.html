<h1 id="introspection-1">Introspection 1</h1>
<p>1st. Believe in yourself. Remember that you are building a future and
be part of an organization that's going to shape the way people all
live, and think that, “If someone can be part of 1%, you can too.”
whether the path ahead seems crumbling, challenging, or even the ground
cracks open, or rocks fall from the sky, trust that it will unfold
exactly as you need it to. Do not seek for other people's approval. Have
faith in yourself—just believe in you, only you.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-2">Introspection 2</h1>
<p>2nd. Don’t place any value on others' judgments or beliefs about you.
Many people, even those close to you or even family, may try to elevate
themselves by doubting your path, time and efforts. Look them in the
eye, smile, and recognize how small-minded they must be to focus on
saying something about you that they don't really know about without
understanding your journey. Remember, no words you say can change who
they are, so silence is the best response.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-3">Introspection 3</h1>
<p>3rd. Picture yourself existing on an environment which does not allow
the growth of individual who aspire to go beyond the norms. Those around
you prefer that you work in a job devoid of passion, performing
monotonous tasks day after day. They wouldn’t care to know about what
your work environment is like. Their sole concern is your ability to
earn money to support them and for them to accept that you have a
“work”. I'm convinced they will cease their demands once you achieve
that.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-4">Introspection 4</h1>
<p>4th. It's hard to wait around for something you know might never
happen but it's harder to give up when you know it's everything you
want.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-5">Introspection 5</h1>
<p>5th. Once you commit to shifting into a higher reality, the Universe
will conspire in your favor. The right opportunities will appear, and
the right people will show up—but not until you fully commit to the
path. Once you do, that's when the real magic begins</p>
<h1 id="introspection-6">Introspection 6</h1>
<p>6th. Everyone you meet always asks if you have a career, are in
relationship or own something as if life was some kind of grocery list
but nobody ever asks if you are okay or are happy.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-7">Introspection 7</h1>
<p>7th. To attract better, you have to become better. You can't do the
same things and expect change. Transform your mindset. Upgrade your
habits. Think positive. Be hopeful and consistent with your evolution.
It all starts with you and how you feel about yourself.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-8">Introspection 8</h1>
<p>8th. Discipline is explaining to your brain that you need to
sacrifice immediate pleasures for greater rewards in the future.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-9">Introspection 9</h1>
<p>9th. Some people stop because it's hard, some people start because
it's hard.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-10">Introspection 10</h1>
<p>10th. In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-11">Introspection 11</h1>
<p>11th. Some people always pretend. Always doubt, doubt, and doubt.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-12">Introspection 12</h1>
<p>12th. Above all, don't lie to yourself because a lie cannot live.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-13">Introspection 13</h1>
<p>13th. Vanity prevents improvement.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-14">Introspection 14</h1>
<p>14th. If something is bound to happen, it will happen. If an event
happens, at least once, it implies, that there's a great possibility of
it happening again.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-15">Introspection 15</h1>
<p>15th. It's not what you say, it's what you do.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-16">Introspection 16</h1>
<p>16th. A lion does not concern himself with the opinion of a
sheep.</p>
