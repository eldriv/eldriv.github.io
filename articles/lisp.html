<h1 id="the-first-contact" style="padding-top: 50px;">The First Contact</h1>
<p>In February 2024, I felt lost in an unfamiliar forest, where a strong
aura seemed to fill the air as if someone were watching me. The path
beneath my feet was hard to see, covered by vines and mist. Every step
was an eerie silence; the usual sounds of the forest were gone, and
replaced by a low voice that echoed deep within my body saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You cannot do it, wanderer!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could feel something ancient here as if the land was alive and
aware of my presence. Then, I caught the fast flicker of shadow movement
out of my naked eye. When I turned to look, nothing was there, but I
knew that something was odd in this place. Everything inside me urged me
to follow and figure out what was it, and that’s when the hunt
began.</p>
<h1 id="the-hunt">The hunt</h1>
<p>I can't believe three days have passed already. Then finally, from a
distance, I can sense there was a human—one brimming with energy, his
eyes filled with passion and purpose. There was a fire in his presence,
a certain aura that told me this person had existed in this universe for
a long time. I walked closer to him and asked,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm lost, where am I?"</p>
<p>He replied,</p>
<p>"Haha, you did not know that you're in the Paren universe?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first, I was confused, but he continued speaking in a way I
couldn’t understand, using words I had never heard before. I then shared
my experiences from the day since I got here, and he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't worry wanderer! We call it <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>,
an elitist language used here to express ourselves. You can learn
it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked him everything I wanted to know, and he told me his name was
Zimlav.</p>
<h1 id="exploration">Exploration</h1>
<p>Then the next day, We met again, Zimlav gave me a book to start my
first journey, he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Learning this can give you an understanding of this universe, and as
much as possible, avoid going through with shortcuts."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book he gave me was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_Common_Lisp">Practical
Common Lisp</a> which I managed to finish it within a month. It was an
eye-opening. I didn't realize that Lisp is actually a family of
languages with a long history, and Lisp stands for <strong><strong>List
Processing</strong></strong>. I also discovered that it's an incredibly
powerful and dynamic language with features that are unique in its
universe. When it comes to speed, I noticed that it outpaces the
language I used before in my universe.</p>
<p>To help me understand the differences between our worlds, Zimlav also
sent me references with his self-made courier—a <a
href="https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/pythonvslisp/">Python vs. Lisp</a>
and <a href="https://norvig.com/python-lisp.html">Python and lisp by
Peter Norvig</a>—Also, I learned that Lisp is rich in features and
offers a broad range of built-in functions. It includes top-tier
features such as object-oriented programming, error handling, and
macros, which allow you to create custom utilities for rapid
development. Many of these ideas seemed familiar from what I had seen to
my places before, though likely now, I discovered they were inspired
from Lisp!</p>
<p>I've been in the Paren universe for almost a year now, and within
that time, Zimlav gave me another books such as <a
href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/">Common Lisp: A Gentle
Introduction to Symbolic Computation</a> and <a
href="https://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a>. There’s still
a lot for me to catch up on because, as Zimlav warned, there are no
shortcuts when it comes to mastering this language. It may take time to
absorb everything at different levels. At many times, I always feel like
I'm already late learning everything, seeing how freely people in this
universe can experiment and express themselves.</p>
<p>While reading these books, I managed to wrote a parser, numerous
executable pieces of code, created tests, learned about profiling and
interacted with other Lispers (Yes, that’s what they call themselves).
But that’s enough about me and let’s continue exploring these vast
universe.</p>
<p>The most I like in this universe is its interactive environment, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop">REPL</a>
(Read-Eval-Print Loop). Where Lispers can test and debug code
interactively. Lisp also has its core strengths that lies in type
systems that optimize the performance and safety of your code. It can
also boosts productivity and can achieve rapid prototyping—Yes, you can
just shoot your existing ideas in your own style—because it helps catch
errors earlier by evaluating these functions sooner and receiving type
warnings during compilation, whether for the whole file or just the
current or single function, yes only a single function.</p>
<p>Code is data, and data is code. This isn't just a theoretical
concept—it's a practical advantage that lets you bend the language to
your will. It was invented and designed for expressing algorithms,
making it easier for lisper to write and manipulate code. I learned that
one of its key advantages is that it allows you to write programs that
write programs and promotes code re-use.</p>
<p>Lisp represented as lists, which are constructed with bunch of <a
href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_c.htm#cons">conses</a>.
The structure promotes brevity, making it easier to implement a
bottom-up design. With this approach, you can gradually refine and
clarify your program's design to achieve readability that also useful
for maintainability and extendability that can be beneficial when other
lisper wants to collaborate.</p>
<p>Another good thing with Lisp is its nature, you can have a
multi-paradigm support like functional programming (FP), object-oriented
programming (OOP), or imperative styles. The choice of style depends on
1) the Lisper’s approach and 2) the nature of the problem. That’s the
beauty of it and there are more wild things to come which we will
explore soon.</p>
<p>At first, you might not fully appreciate this universe, but over
time, you'll realize that Paren universe is a fundamentally different
and dynamic language. Like a single pistol but you can shoot in a rapid
fire. As <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)">Paul
Graham</a> aptly put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You don't just write your program down toward the language, you also
build the language up toward your program."</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-elitist">The elitist</h1>
<p>Lisp is a true elitist language. Among all the languages I’ve tried
with the previous universe before, Lisp stands out as the most
consistent, feature-rich in terms of abstraction, and fastest. This
isn’t just my personal opinion—many experienced Lispers who have
backgrounds in various modern languages share the same view and they
transitioned to <code class="verbatim">Paren universe</code> while some
of them are now in some dialects called <code
class="verbatim">Scheme or even in Clojure</code>. In Lisp, The primary
focus is on solving problems using Lisp itself. Zimlav told me to watch
this—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVyoCh2chEs">Rise and Fall
of Lisp</a> that will fill more gaps about the history of it. In my
honest opinion, it’s not about the syntax or any of the superficial
aspects that limits why Lisp is not the most popular universe.</p>
<p>Parentheses scare away some of the programmerer, that only those
truly dedicated could survived the forest. Some avoid it, because it
requires a lot of discipline to learn it effectively. It’s a language
that tends to attract brilliant minds.</p>
<p>In some areas in the forest, there were circulation of topics about
its poor prefix notation and some people argue that it’s primarily for
artificial intelligence, But Lisp has evolved beyond than that, with
difference kind of advancements in both hardware and software making it
more exposed in other universes. Those who have been with <code
class="verbatim">Lisp</code> for a long time understand its value and I
look up those talented hackers and elites who continue to push the
boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
<h1 id="the-ascertainment">The ascertainment</h1>
<p>I always found myself in a great conversation with Zimlav, aside from
being a lisper, he is also an AI researcher for 20 years, and I learned
why modern AI requires so much computational power. The discussion led
me down to a rabbit hole that completely changed my perspective on how
we should build AI systems.</p>
<p>Here's what I discovered, Picture this okay? You've just dropped a
fortune on a blazing-fast 16-core processor. Sweeeet! But here's the
kicker—most of the popular tools we use for AI development in my
previous universe can only effectively use one core at a time. It's like
buying a Ferrari and never taking it out of first gear. In the ecosystem
where they work, the people who are part of this other universe can't
even see that the reason these AI systems are so energy-hungry is
because a huge chunk of them use mainstream languages, and some of them
are not true SMP (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing">Symmetric
Multiprocessing</a>)—The system uses switching to distribute the tasks
across the cores, but it can't use them all simultaneously. This is due
to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">Global
Interpreter Lock (GIL)</a>. So for these universes, they need a lot of
CPUs and servers to distribute the load, when a decent programming
language that supports concurrency should be able to use all the cores
of a CPU simultaneously. If you understand things down at that level,
you have a lot of leverage and finally you can reason out about what
technology to use.</p>
<p>Then as I was thinking about, why we see so much software written for
machine learning, neural networks, and the like in my previous universe?
In my opinion, a lot of the developers in my world before are actually
not a traditional software engineer but come from the academia itself.
Their main focus is testing hypotheses and writing program proofs, not
building industrial-grade applications. Most of them stick to these
modern languages simply because that's what they learned to write their
mathematical equations in, or because it's what everyone else is using
in today's trend.</p>
<p>Sure, my previous universe has given us libraries like NumPy,
PyTorch, and others, the people from my universe might think this puts
other programming approaches at a disadvantage. But now, I can actually
see it differently. These modern approaches are pretty inefficient and
resource-hungry when you really look at them. It's kind of like how an
Roll Royce isn't trying to compete with Toyota—they're serving
completely different markets. It actually reminds me of when I first
read Paul Graham's—<a href="https://paulgraham.com/avg.html">Beating the
Averages</a>. Sometimes there's real value in choosing tools that give
you fundamental advantages, even if they're not what everyone else is
using.</p>
<h1 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h1>
<p>The beauty of Paren universe remains timeless. He who fears nothing
to its depths survives, and if you're just viewing it to 50,000 feet
from distance will never fully grasp the power of Lisp. As a mere
wanderer, start your journey of hunting!</p>
