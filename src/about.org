* A bit of me

This path wasn’t handed to me—it’s one I’ve fought for, piece by piece. And every step, every sleepless nights, every decision, has led me here, and where I’m now—is something much bigger than I can even imagine.

I don’t have all the answers yet, and that’s exactly what fuels me. The unknown doesn’t intimidate me—it challenges me to keep pushing, to keep growing. I thrive in the challenge of building something from the scratch, learning various kinds to expand my skillset, solving problems that don’t have an easy answers, and knowing that what I could create can shift the way people interact with the world. Right now, I am learning from the sharpest minds, and will able to contribute to the world. Building a future that excites me—and, in time, I hope it will inspire others too.
